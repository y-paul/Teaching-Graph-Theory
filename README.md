# Teaching for Graph-Theory Applications 

The following directory includes the presentation ("presentation.rmd/html") aswell as necessary files for generating code and analysis. Note that the markdown-presentation will not compile because most data-files are not included due to copyright reasons.
All different applications are contained within subfolders (social, taylor_swift, wikiepdia, googlemaps), in these subfolders a respective README tells you all you need to now how to download the data or generate it and any other steps required for the code to run.
Some analysis is not done in R, but in Gephi.
